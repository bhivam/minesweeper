# Minesweeper AI Bots

This started off as a project for a Deep Learning class, but now I am expanding upon what I created for the project.

I have created a few bots that can play minsweeper.

So far the bots include a small, basic rule-based bot and two simple CNN-based bots. I will add in more descriptions of these bots later on.

I am going to expand upon this project by using a UNet for segmenting the board into safe and unsafe cells. I think this bot will be really good for learning the rules of minesweeper.
